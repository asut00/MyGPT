=========== UNTRAINED GPT MODEL ===========
===========================================

Untrained model created with the following configuration:
- vocab_size: 50257
- context_length: 256
- emb_dim: 768
- n_heads: 12
- n_layers: 12
- drop_rate: 0.1
- qkv_bias: False
-----
Let's run an inference with our raw untrained model:
Input text:
>>> Every effort moves you
Output text:
>>>  Every effort moves you rentingetic wasnÙ… refres RexMeCHicular stren
-----
As we can see, our untrained model does not produce a good text because... it has not been trained yet!
